# 🌆 CSS Skyline Project – Day/Night Switch

This is a creative mini-project built as part of my [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) **Responsive Web Design** learning journey.

---

### 🧠 What I Learned:
- Using `position: absolute` to stack buildings and background elements
- Creating a skyline effect with `box-shadow` and layered `div`s
- Using CSS media queries to change the entire color scheme dynamically

---

### 🌗 Special Feature:
➡️ **Resize your browser window!**  
As the screen gets wider, the **scene transforms from night to day** using responsive CSS breakpoints.
